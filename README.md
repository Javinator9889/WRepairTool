## Using basic commands
*Microsoft* know how to do a good job, so we **use its tools** for repairing your system, fast and easy.





## *If you have Internet connection ...:*

+ **DISM.EXE**, an utility for checking Windows files and restore them from the latest Windows Image (*using Windows Update*). You can see the [official webpage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825236.aspx) to know more about this utility.

+ **SFC.EXE**. This tool is also known as *System File Checker*: it looks for errors in **Windows File System** and **Windows Registry** (as substitute for *Scanreg.exe*). See [every detail in the official thread](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system).

+ **CHKDSK**: the drive checking tool par excellence: simply *looks for damaged blocks in your drives* and repair them. See how it works [right here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730714(v=ws.10).aspx).


*All these utilities need* **admin access** *for working. If not, the program can't start working*. Also, **DISM.EXE** feature needs *Internet connection* for working. In this case, program has an auto **offline** mode which uses only **SFC.EXE** & **CHKDSK**.



# What I have to download

The files you have to download are:

1. The **Main program**: depending on your Windows version, it can be *64 bits* or *32 bits*.
2. If your OS is **64 bits**...: you *must download* the attached DLLs for making the program work. Maybe they are not necessary, maybe yes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
